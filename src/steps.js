Then, he will hire a <em>subcontractor</em> who is just as qualified to do the job, but he will pay that subcontractor only $8,000 for the job, meaning that the contractor <em>you</em> hired gets to keep $2,000 just for selling the job to you!

They will ask $20 to $50 for each toy, but they have 100 of them for sale and probably bought them all at once for only $5 each. AliExpress is the marketplace where you can pay the $5 instead of the $20-50 that the kiosk is trying to sell them for. As a matter of fact, almost every time I see a mall kiosk I am able to find their exact product offerings on AliExpress for significantly lower cost than they were asking.`,
